# mercato-news

A web app developed with the [MEAN](http://mean.io/) stack

Each soccer offseason is the same story. All sport website try to know before everyone where is the next move !
- Ibrahimovic in Arsenal ?
- Neymar in Paris Saint Germain ?
- Messi in FC Nantes ?

Few are true (Messi in Nantes :)) but the majority is pure speculation (Neymar in PSG, really guys?? )

Let's create an application such as Reddit or Hacker News where anyone can share the last mercato news but let's the users unravel the true from the false with upvoting / commenting actions.
